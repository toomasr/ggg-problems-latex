Go Game Guru Problems - PDF Generation
=======================================

After I stumbled on [Go Game Guru Problems Github Page](https://github.com/gogameguru/go-problems) and went over the PDF
files it generated I realised that I personally like a different type of approach to problem solving.

I like a single PDF with all the problems and only opening up solutions when I'm stuck or I want to make sure I was correct.

Status of the project
=====================

It is right now only a first version as I have generated only the *easy* problems. I'll remove thid disclaimer when I make
progress on this.
